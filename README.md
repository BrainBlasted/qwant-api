# qwant-api-rs

A WIP API wrapper for the [Qwant](https://qwant.com) search engine, written in Rust.
This is a _work-in-progress_ project, based off of an **undocumented, unofficial** API for Qwant
at <api.qwant.com>, and requiring nigtly Rust. Take that as you will. I **_highly recommend_**
that you do not use this for any serious application due to the nature of it.

## Contributing

The best thing you could do to help this project is to **help document the API**. There are a few
things that I am unsure of just from looking at the JSON. Most of the documentation I have so
far is in the doc comments.

You could also contribute by providing suggestions**(preferred)** or PRs for things marked by
`// TODO:`. Suggestions are preferred because this is a learning project for Rust, APIs, and
Serde.
